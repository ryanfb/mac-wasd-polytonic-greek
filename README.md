# mac-wasd-polytonic-greek

A Mac Polytonic Greek keyboard for [WASD 104/87-Key US ANSI Layout](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/). Originally based on `wasd-inkscape-104-11.13.2017` from [here](https://support.wasdkeyboards.com/hc/en-us/articles/115007847008-Download-Template-Files), and inspired by [this layout](https://kprepublic.com/products/kprepublic-139-greek-root-greece-blue-cyan-font-language-cherry-profile-dye-sub-keycap-pbt-for-gh60-xd60-xd84-tada68-87-104).

## Files:

* `wasd-inkscape-104-11.13.2017-polytonic-greek.svg` - Inkscape SVG file for Polytonic Greek *before* paths-only conversion. You should still be able to edit the text in this file.
* `wasd-inkscape-104-11.13.2017-polytonic-greek-paths-only.svg` - Inkscape SVG file for Polytonic Greek *after* paths-only conversion. This is the final layout I submitted. Note I also made some other small tweaks after the paths-only conversion (small shifts to positioning, and added media icons on the media button cluster above the arrow keys, and an eject icon on f13).
